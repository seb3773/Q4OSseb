 \e[39m  Qlaptop script is designed to configure the Q4OS Trinity system for usage on
   a laptop by installing some tools like TLP and changing TDEpowersave (which doesn't
   work well on some systems I tried) for the xfce4-power-manager. It will setup
   lid action too, swap if doesn't exist yet and suspend-then-hibernate action.
